The series “All my secrets” was born in 2010, as a diverse form of artist book,
questioning my identity as a trilingual. 
I began wondering, which is my true mother language? 

This theme is conveyed with one repeated sentence, in nine different languages (the sum of languages spoken between me, my family, friends and neighbours): “If you can read this, you know all my secrets”.
The thought was that the one viewer that will recognise and know (to some extent) all nine languages, would be the one who might share with me the same culture, hence, knowing all my secrets.

Throughout the works, everything is about Text and Texture. At some point, the text loses it’s meaning and becomes an image (For example: a foreign language that the viewer doesn’t know or when the text is distorted). In other times, the meaning comes from an image where the viewer recognises a familiar language,
and wonders upon the other languages.

In some cases, I share other ’secrets’ about me, through consumed goods which I chose the reuse its’ package: a specific brand, a favourite food (Chocolate!), and others.
