As a part of a twin cities project, i was invited to participate in Traces of Dialogue symposium / artist residency.

Preparing for the project, I was delighted to discover that the city has its own local historical language,
the MaseMatte. This language was created as a means of basic communication between immigrant workers. It’s a mixture of german, Yiddish and a local dialect.
The name MaseMatte was, presumably, derived form the term “Masso u Mattan” in Yiddish,
which means ‘Negotiation’.

Since this language is hardly at use today (besides some slang words) I had to search for any remaining vocabulary and its translation to german and hebrew.
This Lexicon came with me to Münster as the basis for the suggested project.

The project is site specific, created during our ten day of work at the Am-HawerKamp studios.

The heavily industrial setting gave a great start for the project, offering an echo to this very basic language of workers, as they met to build the railway station in the same neighbourhood.

My Installation was composed of three parts:

1.  A graffiti with chalk on a dusted wall
2.  Crocheted words (the “Crocheted Graffiti”) on metal doors and windows
3.  Transparent cut film words and graffiti installation on a wall of electric boards.

This basic worker language in its various translation was met with very delicate means as a contrast, negotiating old and new, harsh and delicacy.
