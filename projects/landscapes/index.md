I have grown in one place, lived in another and so back and forth. This change of places makes me muse often about my cultural identity and belonging.

Initially, i explored this theme through oil paintings and drawings of Landscapes out of memories and internal visions, working to figure out my Homeland and ideal place. The first paintings were about traveling between places through portals. The paintings express mixed impressions of the views in the present place I traveled to, to study, with longing to the views of home and other times. The Paintings included clouds or fog, city scape vs. natural scape and trees.Those were also my first paintings in bigger format, as till then, i was used to small scale book illustrations.

The transition between the landscape painting to the textual monochromatic work of today,
occurred simultaneously with two constraints:

I had to cease using oil paints and acrylic paints didn’t give me the same satisfaction, and I had taken two different courses where I was asked to do self portraits (a theme far from my comfort zone).
So naturally, questions about identity rose up and took a more linguistic turn.

The landscapes formed into words, put together into a concrete question (Resulting in the “All My Secrets” Series).
