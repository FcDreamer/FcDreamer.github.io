### About the artist

Hi, my name is Iamit. 
I am a text-based, visual artist and Illustrator.
​
My education includes a B.A in visual arts from Brera Academy of arts in Milan, Italy; Diploma of Practical Engineer of Architecture and internal design,
Graphic Design and more goodies.
​
### About the Art

Text is my biggest passion right now: I play with it with various materials and methods, including crocheted text artworks or, as I enjoy calling it, "Crocheted Graffiti".

I usually work in series. The artworks are intimate and intricate; made from combination of plastics, natural and recycled materials.
Through the works I examine my creative and mental process while bringing up and exploring different issues about identity and place. I utilise either original or cited text, from the bible, literature and pop culture.

### Other things

In addition to my studio practice, I offer custom pet portraits and nursery drawings at my [Etsy shop](https://Petcisely.etsy.com/).
